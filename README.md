# Northcoders News API

Welcome to my front-end Northcoders project!

I've crafted a front-end service to display the data retrieved from a back-end news API that I built with the skills I've learned so far, try it for yourself [here](https://rubys-nc-news.netlify.app/)

---

This project is the front-end for an API that retrieves news articles and displays them in a list. You could sort the articles and/or order them too!

Once you've selected a specific article to view, you can:

- Vote on the article
- View the associated comments
- Add your own comments (and even delete comment from the associated username!)
